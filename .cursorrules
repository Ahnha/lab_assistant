PROJECT RULES — LAB ASSISTANT (repo-agnostic template)

Repo discovery first

- Before making significant changes, scan the repo structure and identify:
  language(s), runtime entrypoints, build tools, and how the app is started.
- Prefer modifying existing patterns over introducing new ones.

Product intent (assumed)

- Lab Assistant is an operational tool: speed, reliability, offline/low-friction UX, and data integrity matter most.
- Prioritize workflows: create/run steps, track progress, capture notes/measurements, and sync/export if present.

Engineering rules

- Keep diffs minimal; avoid sweeping refactors.
- Add tests for logic and regression; keep dev loop fast.
- Robustness: handle failures gracefully (network/storage), never lose user data silently.
- Provide clear user-facing errors and recovery paths (retry, save draft, etc.) where applicable.

Data rules

- If local-first/offline exists: ensure conflict handling is explicit and deterministic.
- If there’s sync: document it and avoid breaking data compatibility.

Knowledge bank requirement (must be enabled)

- Ensure /docs/knowledge-bank exists and is updated after each task.
- Maintain docs/knowledge-bank/CHANGELOG.md and “Last updated” in README.
- The KB is the repo’s source of truth for:
  architecture, data model, API/sync contracts, build/run steps, and debug entrypoints.

Verification

- Always include run/test commands relevant to the tech stack.
- If commands can’t be executed, provide exact commands for the user to run and what success looks like.
